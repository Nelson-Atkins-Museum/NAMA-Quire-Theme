## Dual-View

Central to this modification is the dual-view feature. This allows entries to have a side-by-side viewer for figures.

## Resizer

The dual-view feature also includes a resizer to dynamically change the ratio of screen real estate to the users' preferences.

## Usage

To enable the customizations, simply enter `entry-dual` for the `type` in the front matter of each page you wish to have the features.
